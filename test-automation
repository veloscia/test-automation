Here's a structured prompt pair for your request:

### Prompt Pair

#### Prompt for Context (User Prompt):
"You are a test automation engineer skilled in object-oriented programming. I want you to develop a testing framework using Selenium, C#, NUnit, and incorporating the headless browser option. You should implement Object-Oriented design principles such as interfaces, encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.

Please create a JSON configuration file named 'application.config' that includes the following parameters: URL, browser type, and an option for running in headless mode. 

Additionally, establish a BaseSetup abstract class that includes:
1. A method to read and deserialize the 'application.config' file.
2. A method for file reporting.
3. Setup and TearDown methods.
4. A method to determine which browser driver to use based on the configuration file.

The browser driver should utilize a switch case structure to choose between Firefox, Edge, and Chrome.

Make sure the BaseSetup class contains all logic without creating a separate configuration class. 

Follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, where each webpage will have a dedicated class encapsulating its elements. The Page Object Factory should be initialized in the constructor of these classes, which will expose public methods for interacting with the encapsulated elements. Each page class should implement its own interface with the relevant methods for testing.

For testing purposes, use the URL 'https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/' and create a test for the login functionality."

#### Prompt for Implementation (Assistant Response):
"To implement the suggestions made, follow these steps:

1. **Create the JSON Configuration File**: 
   - Create 'application.config' with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "URL": "https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/",
     "BrowserType": "Chrome",  // or "Firefox" or "Edge"
     "Headless": true
   }
   ```

2. **Develop the BaseSetup Class**:
   ```csharp
   public abstract class BaseSetup
   {
       protected string Url { get; private set; }
       protected string BrowserType { get; private set; }
       protected bool Headless { get; private set; }

       public BaseSetup()
       {
           ReadConfig();
           // Setup method calls
           Setup();
       }

       private void ReadConfig()
       {
           // Logic to read and deserialize application.config file
           // Set Url, BrowserType, and Headless from JSON
       }

       public virtual void Setup()
       {
           // Logic for Setup
       }

       public virtual void TearDown()
       {
           // Logic for TearDown
       }

       public void InitializeDriver()
       {
           switch (BrowserType.ToLower())
           {
               case "chrome":
                   // Create ChromeDriver instance
                   break;
               case "firefox":
                   // Create FirefoxDriver instance
                   break;
               case "edge":
                   // Create EdgeDriver instance
                   break;
               default:
                   throw new NotSupportedException("Browser type not supported");
           }
       }

       // Additional methods for reporting
   }
   ```

3. **Create Page Object Model Classes**:
   ```csharp
   public class LoginPage
   {
       private IWebDriver driver;

       public LoginPage(IWebDriver driver)
       {
           this.driver = driver;
           // Initialize page elements
       }

       // Encapsulated elements and methods
   }

   public interface ILoginPage
   {
       // Method signatures for the login page
   }
   ```

4. **Implement Testing**:
   Create a test class that extends NUnit's Test class and utilizes the BaseSetup class to perform the login test.
   ```csharp
   [TestFixture]
   public class LoginTests : BaseSetup
   {
       [Test]
       public void TestLogin()
       {
           // Arrange
           var loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
           
           // Act
           // Call methods to perform login
           
           // Assert
           // Validate login success
       }
   }
   ```

By following the above structure, you will have a robust automation testing framework using the specified technologies and design principles."
